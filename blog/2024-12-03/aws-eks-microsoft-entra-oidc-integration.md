## Understanding SSO, OIDC, and Microsoft Entra

In the context of enhancing digital security and user experience, we prioritize the integration of three key elements: Single Sign-On (SSO), OpenID Connect (OIDC), and Microsoft Entra. Hereâ€™s how they connect:

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** serves as the foundation, enabling users to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials, significantly simplifying the authentication process.

- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** builds on the SSO framework by providing an authentication layer, which uses straightforward identity verification to ensure secure and seamless access across services.

- **Microsoft Entra** (formerly known as **Azure Active Directory**) is Microsoft's comprehensive identity and access management solution. It supports the implementation of both Single Sign-On (SSO) and OpenID Connect (OIDC), enabling organizations to securely manage user identities and enforce access controls. With its reliable set of tools, Microsoft Entra simplifies authentication, enhances security, and ensures seamless access to applications and services, making it an essential platform for modern identity management.

Together, these technologies streamline the login process, reinforce security, and enhance the user experience by allowing secure, seamless navigation across our digital ecosystem.

### Microsoft Entra Overview

Microsoft Entra, formerly known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is a modern identity and access management solution designed for secure access to applications and services. It provides features like Single Sign-On (SSO), identity federation, and seamless integration with on-premises directories such as LDAP and Active Directory. Microsoft Entra supports industry-standard protocols, including OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, making it a versatile solution for managing user identities. By leveraging Microsoft Entra, organizations can enhance security, simplify user access, and avoid the complexities of building identity management features from scratch.

    - **Issuer URL**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Tenant-ID>/`, where `<Tenant-ID>` is the **Directory** (tenant) **ID**. Ensure that the URL ends with `/`.
    - **Client ID**: `<Application (client) ID>`, which corresponds to the **Application** (client) **ID** of the OIDC Application.
    - **Username Claim**: `upn`.
    - **Groups Claim**: `groups`.

      ![Identity Provider Details](../assets/aws-eks-microsoft-entra-oidc-integration/identity-provider-details.png)

4. The process of applying the changes may take a few minutes. Once completed, the Microsoft Entra OIDC identity provider will be associated with the AWS EKS cluster.

### Method 2: Using Terraform

To configure Microsoft Entra as an Identity Provider in AWS EKS using Terraform, you can use [AWS EKS Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/20.30.1). Here's an example of how you can do it:

    - **variables.tf**:

    ```hcl
    variable "cluster_identity_providers" {
      description = "Configuration for OIDC identity provider"
      type        = any
      default     = {}
    }
    ```

    - **terraform.tfvars**:

    ```hcl
    cluster_identity_providers = {
      entra = {
        client_id    = "<Application (client) ID>"
        issuer_url   = "https://sts.windows.net/<Tenant ID>/"
        groups_claim = "groups"
        username_claim  = "upn"
      }
    }
    ```

    - **main.tf**:

    ```hcl
    module "eks" {
      source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
      version = "20.14.0"
      ...
      # OIDC Identity provider
      cluster_identity_providers = var.cluster_identity_providers
    }
    ```

After applying the Terraform configuration, the Microsoft Entra OIDC identity provider will be associated with the AWS EKS cluster.

## Configuring RBAC Resources in AWS EKS cluster for Microsoft Entra User Groups

In this section, user authorization will be configured using Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Microsoft Entra groups will be linked to Kubernetes ClusterRoles through ClusterRoleBinding resources, enabling precise control over resource access within the EKS cluster. Additionally, Roles and RoleBindings can be used for more granular access control within specific namespaces.

:::note
The **Object ID** of the Microsoft Entra group can be found in the **Overview** section of the group in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center.
![Group Object ID](../assets/aws-eks-microsoft-entra-oidc-integration/group-object-id.png)
:::

1. Log in to the AWS EKS cluster and create the following **ClusterRoleBinding** resource, which associates the Microsoft Entra group `oidc-cluster-admins` with the `cluster-admin` Kubernetes Cluster Role. Replace `<your-microsoft-entra-admin-group-object-id>` with the Object ID of the `oidc-cluster-admins` group, which can be found on the `Group` overview page in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: oidc-cluster-admins
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: cluster-admin
    subjects:
      - kind: Group
        name: <your-microsoft-entra-admin-group-object-id>
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

    Save the above YAML to a file, for example, `clusterrolebinding.yaml`, and apply it to the EKS cluster using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f clusterrolebinding.yaml
    ```

    The `oidc-cluster-admins` group will now have `cluster-admin` permissions within the EKS cluster.

## Authenticating to AWS EKS using Microsoft Entra with kubectl

To authenticate to the AWS EKS cluster using Microsoft Entra, you can use the `kubectl` CLI tool with the `kubelogin` plugin. The `kubelogin` plugin simplifies the OIDC authentication process by handling the token exchange and session management. Here's how you can authenticate to the EKS cluster:

1. Create or update the kubeconfig file with the OIDC configuration. Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your EKS cluster and `<region-code>` with the AWS region code where the cluster is located.

    ```bash
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region-code> --name <cluster-name>
    ```

2. Execute the following command to create a new kubeconfig context using the `kubelogin` plugin. Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your EKS cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl config set-credentials "eks" \
      --exec-api-version=client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1 \
      --exec-command=kubelogin \
      --exec-arg=get-token \
      --exec-arg=--oidc-issuer-url \
      --exec-arg=https://sts.windows.net/<Tenant ID>/ \
      --exec-arg=--oidc-client-id \
      --exec-arg=<Application (client) ID> \
      --exec-arg=--oidc-client-secret \
      --exec-arg=<Application (client) Secret>
    ```

    Replace `<Tenant ID>`, `<Application (client) ID>`, and `<Application (client) Secret>` with the corresponding values from the OIDC Application in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center.

    :::note
    You can test the authentication to the EKS cluster immediately by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl --user=eks get nodes
    ```

    :::

3. Set the context for the kubeconfig file to use the `eks` user and the OIDC configuration. Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your EKS cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl config set-context eks --user=eks --cluster=<cluster-name>
    ```

    To switch to the `eks` context, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl config use-context eks
    ```

    Test the authentication by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

## Configuring KubeRocketCi Portal with Microsoft Entra OIDC Authentication

1. Starting from version 3.11, KubeRocketCI platform supports Microsoft Entra as an Identity Provider for OIDC authentication in the Portal UI. To configure Microsoft Entra OIDC authentication, navigate to the [edp-install](https://github.com/epam/edp-install) Helm chart repository and set the following values in the `values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    ...
    edp-headlamp:
      enabled: true
      config:
        oidc:
          enabled: true
          issuerUrl: "https://sts.windows.net/<Tenant ID>/"
          clientID: "<Application (client) ID>"
          clientSecretName: "<name of the secret containing the client-secret value>"
          clientSecretKey: "clientSecret"
    ...
    ```

    Replace `<Tenant ID>` and `<Application (client) ID>` with the corresponding values from the OIDC Application in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center. Also, specify the name of the Kubernetes Secret containing the Application **Client secret** value in the `clientSecretName` field.

2. In the Microsoft Entra Admin Center, navigate to the created OIDC Application and select the **Authentication** section. In the **Redirect URIs** field, add the URL of the KubeRocketCI Portal, for example, `https://portal-<krci-namespace>.<dns-wildcard>/oidc-callback`.

    ![Redirect URIs](../assets/aws-eks-microsoft-entra-oidc-integration/redirect-uris.png)

3. After applying the changes, the KubeRocketCI Portal will be configured to use Microsoft Entra OIDC authentication. Users will be able to log in to the Portal using **Sign In** option.
