 ||||
 | **EDP Business Entity** - a part of the CI/CD process (the integration, delivery, and deployment of any codebase changes) |**Application** - a codebase type that is built as the binary artifact and deployable unit with the code that is stored in VCS. As a result, the application becomes a container and can be deployed in an environment.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Autotests** - a codebase type that inspects a product (e.g. an application set) on a stage. Autotests are not deployed to any container and launched from the respective code stage.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**CD Pipeline (Continuous Delivery Pipeline)** - an EDP business entity that describes the whole delivery process of the selected application set via the respective stages. The main idea of the CD pipeline is to promote the application version between the stages by applying the sequential verification (i.e. the second stage will be available if the verification on the first stage is successfully completed). _**NOTE**: The CD pipeline can include the essential set of applications with its specific stages as well._|
 |                                                                                                                           |**CD Pipeline Stage** - an EDP business entity that is presented as the logical gate required for the application set inspection. Every stage has one OpenShift project where the selected application set is deployed. All stages are sequential and promote applications one-by-one.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Codebase** - an EDP business entity that possesses a code.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Codebase Branch** - an EDP business entity that represents a specific version in a Git branch. Every codebase branch has a Codebase Docker Stream entity.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Codebase Docker Stream** - a deployable component that leads to the application build and displays that the last build was verified on the specific stage. Every CD pipeline stage accepts a set of Codebase Docker Streams (CDS) that are input and output. _SAMPLE: if an application1 has a master branch, the input CDS will be named as [app name]-[pipeline name]-[stage name]-[master] and the output after the passing of the DEV stage will be as follows: [app name]-[pipeline name]-[stage name]-[dev]-[verified]._|
 |                                                                                                                            |**Git Server** - a custom resource that is responsible for integration with Version Control System (VCS), whether it is GitHub, GitLab or Gerrit.|
 |                                                                                                                            |**Infrastructure** - a codebase type that is used to define and manage the underlying infrastructure of projects using the *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)* approach, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Library** - a codebase type that is built as the binary artifact, i.e. it`s stored in the Artifactory and can be uploaded by other applications, autotests or libraries.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Quality Gate** - an EDP business entity that represents the minimum acceptable results after the testing. Every stage has a quality gate that should be passed to promote the application. The stage quality gate can be a manual approve from a QA specialist OR a successful autotest launch.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Quality Gate Type** - this value defines trigger type that promotes artifacts (images) to the next environment in CD Pipeline. There are manual and automatic types of quality gates. The manual type means that the promoting process should be confirmed in Tekton. The automatic type promotes the images automatically in case there are no errors in the Allure Report. _**NOTE**: If any of the test types is not passed, the CD pipeline will fail._|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Trigger Type** - a value that defines a trigger type used for the CD pipeline triggering. There are manual and automatic types of triggering. The manual type means that the CD pipeline should be triggered manually. The automatic type triggers the CD pipeline automatically as soon as the Codebase Docker Stream was changed.|
