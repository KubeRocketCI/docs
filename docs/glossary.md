 | Terms  | Details  |
 |---|---|
| **Platform Component** - an item used in the CI/CD process |**Portal UI** - component that facilitates the management, setup, and control of business entities.|
 |                                                   |**Artifactory** - component that serves as a repository for all binary artifacts. _**NOTE**: Nexus is a possible implementation of a repository._|

 |                                                   |**Static Code Analyzer** - component that continuously inspects code quality before changes are merged into the master branch. _**NOTE**: SonarQube is a possible implementation of a static code analyzer._|
 |                                                   |**VCS (Version Control System)** - a repository that tracks all changes made by developers. _**NOTE**: GitHub and GitLab are possible implementations of a version control system._|
 | **KubeRocketCI Business Entity** - a part of the CI/CD process (the integration, delivery, and deployment of any codebase changes) |**Application** - a codebase type that is built as the binary artifact and deployable unit with the code that is stored in VCS. As a result, the application becomes a container and can be deployed in an environment.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Autotests** - a codebase type that inspects a product (e.g. an application set) on a Deployment Stage. Autotests are not deployed to any container and launched from the respective code repository.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**CD Pipeline (Continuous Delivery Pipeline)** - business entity that describes the whole delivery process of the selected application set via the respective stages. The main idea of the CD pipeline is to promote the application version between the stages by applying the sequential verification (i.e. the second stage will be available if the verification on the first stage is successfully completed). _**NOTE**: The CD pipeline can include the essential set of applications with its specific stages as well._|
 |                                                                                                                           |**CD Pipeline Stage** - business entity that is presented as the logical gate required for the application set inspection. Every stage has one OpenShift project where the selected application set is deployed. All stages are sequential and promote applications one-by-one.|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Codebase** - business entity that possesses a code.|

 |                                                                                                                           |**Codebase Docker Stream** - a deployable component that leads to the application build and displays that the last build was verified on the specific stage. Every CD pipeline stage accepts a set of Codebase Image Streams (cbis) that are input and output. _SAMPLE: if an application1 has a master branch, the input cbis will be named as [app name]-[pipeline name]-[stage name]-[master] and the output after the passing of the DEV stage will be as follows: [app name]-[pipeline name]-[stage name]-[dev]-[verified]._|
 |                                                                                                                            |**Git Server** - a custom resource that is responsible for integration with Version Control System (VCS), whether it is GitHub, GitLab or Gerrit.|
 |                                                                                                                            |**Infrastructure** - a codebase type that is used to define and manage the underlying infrastructure of projects using the _Infrastructure as Code (IaC)_ approach, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.|

 |                                                                                                                           |**Quality Gate Type** - this value defines trigger type that promotes artifacts (images) to the next environment in CD Pipeline. There are manual and automatic types of quality gates. The manual type means that the promoting process should be confirmed in Tekton. The automatic type promotes the images automatically in case there are no errors in the Allure Report. _**NOTE**: If any of the test types is not passed, the CD pipeline will fail._|
 |                                                                                                                           |**Trigger Type** - a value that defines a trigger type used for the CD pipeline triggering. There are manual and automatic types of triggering. The manual type means that the CD pipeline should be triggered manually. The automatic type triggers the CD pipeline automatically as soon as the Codebase Docker Stream was changed.|
