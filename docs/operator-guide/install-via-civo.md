## Launch Cluster

The first step of the installation procedure is to launch the cluster. Please refer to the [official instructions](https://www.civo.com/docs/kubernetes/create-a-cluster) that describe this process in detail. To succeed, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to the personal account.

2. Create a new Kubernetes cluster with the parameters below. Please refer to the [official guidelines](https://www.civo.com/docs/kubernetes/create-a-cluster) for more details:

  * **Name**: `demo`
  * **How many nodes**: 1
  * **Select size**: Type: Standard, Size: Medium
  * **Network**: Default
  * **Firewall**: Create a new firewall with the 443 and 6443 ports opened
  * **Advanced options**: Kubernetes version: latest (currently 1.28.2)
  * **Marketplace**: Choose the Argo CD and Tekton stacks

3. Wait till the cluster is created.

  !!! note
      The cluster deployment takes around two minutes. After cluster deployment, additional 5 minutes are required for both Argo CD and Tekton stacks to get deployed.

4. As soon as cluster is deployed, ensure all the marketplace applications are installed, too:

5. Download and apply the kubeconfig file:

  ![Download kubeconfig](../assets/operator-guide/download-kubeconfig.png "Download kubeconfig")

6. Ensure all the pods are up and running in both the Tekton and Argo CD namespaces after 5 minutes of waiting. Restart deployments if the pods are failed to deploy:

      kubectl get ns
      kubectl get pods -n tekton-pipelines
      kubectl get pods -n argocd

## Install EDP

As soon as the cluster is deployed, it is time to install the EDP application.

1. In the Civo portal, navigate to **Marketplace** -> **CI/CD**:

4. Wait till all the pods are up and running. Use the `kubectl get pods` command to check the status of the pods:

      kubectl get pods -n edp

  ![EDP pods](../assets/operator-guide/civo-check-edp-ns.png "EDP pods")

5. As soon as all the pods are deployed. Navigate to the **Cluster Information** tab and copy the DNS name:
