!!! info
    In EDP release 3.5, we have changed the deployment strategy for the nexus-operator component, now it is not installed by default. The `nexusURL` parameter management has been transferred from the values.yaml file to Kubernetes secrets.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

* [Kubectl](https://v1-26.docs.kubernetes.io/releases/download/) version 1.26.0 is installed.
* [Helm](https://helm.sh) version 3.12.0+ is installed.

## Installation

To install Nexus with pre-defined templates, use the nexus-operator installed via [Cluster Add-Ons](https://github.com/epam/edp-cluster-add-ons) approach.

## Configuration

To ensure strong authentication and accurate access control, creating a Nexus Sonatype service account with the name  ci.user  is crucial. This user serves as a unique identifier, facilitating connection with the EDP ecosystem.

To create the Nexus `ci.user`and define repository parameters follow the steps below: <a name="values"></a>

1. Open the Nexus UI and navigate to `Server administration and configuration` -> `Security` -> `User`. Click the `Create local user` button to create a new user:

  ![Nexus user settings](../assets/operator-guide/nexus-settings-user.png "Nexus user settings")

2. Type the `ci-user` username, define an expiration period, and click the `Generate` button to create the token:

  ![Nexus create user](../assets/operator-guide/nexus-create-user.png "Nexus create user")

3. EDP relies on a predetermined repository naming convention all repository names are predefined. Navigate to `Server administration and configuration` -> `Repository` -> `Repositories` in Nexus. You can only create a repository with the required language.

4. Provision secrets using manifest, EDP Portal or with the externalSecrets operator

=== "EDP Portal"

    Go to **EDP Portal** -> **EDP** -> **Configuration** -> **Nexus**. Update or fill in the **URL**, **nexus-user-id**, **nexus-user-password** and click the **Save** button:

    ![Nexus update manual secret](../assets/operator-guide/nexus-secret-password.png "Nexus update manual secret")

=== "Manifest"

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: ci-nexus
      namespace: edp
      labels:
        app.edp.epam.com/secret-type: nexus
        app.edp.epam.com/integration-secret: "true"
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      url: https://nexus.example.com
      username: <nexus-user-id>
      password: <nexus-user-password>
    ```

=== "External Secrets Operator"

    ```json
    "ci-nexus":
    {
      "url": "https://nexus.example.com",
      "username": "XXXXXXX",
      "password": "XXXXXXX"
    },
    ```

    Go to **EDP Portal** -> **EDP** -> **Configuration** -> **Nexus** and see `Managed by External Secret` message.
