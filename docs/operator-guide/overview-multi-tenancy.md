# Overview

The EDP leverages the multi-tenancy approach to deliver a business-centric solution for managing containerized applications. The essence of this approach lies in using the additional tools for efficient resource allocation in a Kubernetes cluster. This approach grants tenants a considerable level of autonomy without risking the overall system's security and stability. It allows different users or teams to share the resources of a single Kubernetes cluster while keeping their workloads isolated. The resulting benefits include cost reduction, increased efficiency, improved scalability, and enhanced system resilience.

The EDP project inherently can work with Capsule and Kiosk, two tools that enable managing multi-tenancy. While Kiosk empowers the creation of isolated environments within a Kubernetes cluster, Capsule extends these capabilities further by imposing restrictions on resource usage. Through effective use of these tools, the EDP project offers a robust multi-tenancy model that ensures optimal resource utilization and secure separation of responsibilities.
