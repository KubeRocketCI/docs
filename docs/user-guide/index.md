* **Application widgets** – shows the information on codebases created in the default and allowed namespaces, reflecting the overall amount of entities and their statuses.
* **Top bar panel** – contains documentation link, notifications, KubeRocketCI portal settings, and cluster settings, such as default and allowed namespaces.
* **Quick links** – displays the corresponding links to the major adjusted toolset.
* **Pipeline runs** – displays all the pipeline runs initiated in both the default and allowed namespaces.

KubeRocketCI portal is a complete tool allowing to manage and control the codebases (applications, autotests, libraries and infrastructures) added to the environment as well as to create a CD pipeline.
