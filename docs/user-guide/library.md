# Manage Libraries

This section describes the subsequent possible actions that can be performed with the newly added or existing libraries.

## Check and Remove Library

As soon as the library is successfully provisioned, the following will be created:

- A Library Codebase type will appear in the Codebase list of the Components section.
- With the **Create** strategy, a new project will be generated on GitHub or another integrated VCS. When **Clone** is chosen, the repository will be forked from the original and copied to the KubeRocketCI-integrated repository. If **Import** is selected, the platform connects to the chosen repository.


!!! info
    To navigate quickly to OpenShift, Tekton, Gerrit, SonarQube, Nexus, and other resources, click the **Overview** section on the navigation bar and hit the necessary link.

The added library will be listed in the Libraries list allowing to do the following:

![Library menu](../assets/user-guide/edp-portal-library-page.png "Library menu")

* **Library status** - displays the library status. Can be red or green depending on if the KubeRocketCI portal managed to connect to the Git Server with the specified credentials or not.
* **Library name (clickable)** - displays the library name set during the library creation.
* **Open documentation** - opens the library related documentation page.
* **Enable filtering** - enables filtering by library name and namespace where this custom resource is located in.
* **Create new library** - displays the **Create new component** menu.
* **Edit library** - edit the library by selecting the options icon next to its name in the libraries list, and then selecting **Edit**. For details see the [Edit Existing Library](#edit-existing-library) section.
* **Delete Library** - remove library by clicking the vertical ellipsis button and then selecting **Delete**.

  !!! note
      The library that is used in a CD pipeline cannot be removed.

There are also options to sort the libraries:

* Sort the existing libraries in a table by clicking the sorting icons in the table header. Sort the libraries alphabetically by their name, language, build tool, framework, and CI tool. You can also sort the libraries by their status: Created, Failed, or In progress.
* Select a number of libraries displayed per page (15, 25 or 50 rows) and navigate between pages if the number of libraries exceeds the capacity of a single page.
