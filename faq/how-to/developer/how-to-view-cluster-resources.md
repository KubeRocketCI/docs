If you can't see the resources, there might be two reasons:

1. You don't have sufficient rights. Ensure to have correct [Keycloak role and group membership](../../../docs/operator-guide/auth/platform-auth-model#keycloak-roles-and-groups).
2. You didn't set default and allowed namespaces in the [KubeRocketCI portal](../../../docs/user-guide/portal-settings#cluster).
