# Scaffold and Deploy FastAPI Application

## Overview

This use case outlines the process of creating and deploying a FastAPI application using a scaffolding tool. The purpose is to provide developers with a streamlined approach to generate a functional code structure for a FastAPI web application, including basic read functionality. The process also allows for customization to meet specific requirements and deployment to a development environment. By utilizing a standardized process for code review, testing, and deployment, developers can save time and effort while ensuring high code quality and reliability. The ultimate goal is to empower the development team to release new features and applications more efficiently, while maintaining a high level of code quality and reliability. The KubeRocketCI is used to facilitate this process.

## Scenario

To scaffold and deploy FastAPI Application, follow the steps below.

### Scaffold the New FastAPI Application

1. Open the Portal URL. Use the Sign-In option.

    ![Logging Page](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/login.png "Logging screen")

2. Ensure `Namespace` value in the User `Settings` tab points to the namespace with the KubeRocketCI installation.

    ![Settings](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/settings.png "Settings button")

3. Create the new `Codebase` with the `Application` type using the `Create` strategy.

    ![Cluster Overview](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/cluster-overview.png "Cluster overview")

4. Select the `Components` Section under the EDP tab and push the create `+` button.

    ![Components Overview](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/components.png "Components tab")

5. Choose the `Application` Codebase type as we intend to deliver our application as a container and deploy it within the Kubernetes cluster. Opt for the `Create` strategy to scaffold our application from the template provided by the KubeRocketCI and click the `Proceed` button.

    ![Codebase Info](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/step-codebase-info.png "Step codebase info")

6. On the Application Info tab, define the following values and press the `Proceed` button:

    - Application name: `fastapi-demo`
    - Default branch: `main`
    - Application code language: `Python`
    - Language version/framework: `FastAPI`
    - Build tool: `Python`

    ![Application Info](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/application-info.png "Application info")

7. On the `Advances Settings` tab, define the below values and push the `Apply` button:

    - CI tool: `Tekton`
    - Codebase versioning type: `edp`
    - Start version from: `0.0.1` and `SNAPSHOT`

    ![Advanced Settings](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/advanced-settings.png "Advanced settings")

8. Check the application status. It should be green:

    ![Components overview page](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/components-with-app.png "Application status")

### Deploy Application to the Development Environment

This section outlines the approach for deploying the application from the latest commit on the `main` branch. The following steps are involved:

1. Build the initial version of the application from the last commit on the `main` branch. This version is generated from the provided template.

2. Set up a `CD Pipeline` to enable continuous delivery to the development environment.

3. Deploy the initial version of the application to the development environment.

To succeed with the steps above, follow the instructions below:

1. Build Container from the latest branch commit. To build the initial version of the application's main branch, go to the fastapi-demo application -> branches -> main and select the `Build` menu.

    ![Build Main Branch](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/build-initial-version.png "Application building")

2. Build pipeline for the `fastapi-demo` application starts.

    ![Branch Build Pipeline](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/trigger-build-pipeline.png "Pipeline building")

3. Track Pipeline's status by accessing **Tekton Dashboard** by clicking the `fastapi-demo-main-build-lb57m` application link.

    ![Alt text](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/tekton-build-pipeline.png "Console logs")

4. Ensure that Build Pipeline was successfully completed.

5. To enable application deployment create a CD Pipeline with a single environment - Development (with the name `dev`).

6. Go to UI Portal -> EDP -> CD Pipelines tab and push the `+` button to create pipeline. In the `Create CD Pipeline` dialog, define the below values:

    - **Pipeline tab**:

      - Pipeline name: `mypipe`
      - Deployment type: `Container`, since we are going to deploy containers

      ![CD Pipeline name](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/cdpipeline-step1.png "Pipeline tab with parameters")

    - **Applications tab**. Add `fastapi-demo` application, select `main` branch, and leave `Promote in pipeline` unchecked:

      ![CD Pipeline Add Application](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/cdpipeline-step2.png "Applications tab with parameters")

    - **Stages tab**. Add the `dev` stage with the values below:
      - Stage name: `dev`
      - Description: `Development Environment`
      - Trigger type: `Manual`. We plan to deploy applications to this environment manually
      - Quality gate type: `Manual`
      - Step name: `approve`
      - Push the `Apply` button

      ![CD Pipeline Add Stage](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/cdpipeline-step3.png "Stages tab with parameters")

7. Deploy the initial version of the application to the development environment:

    - Open CD Pipeline with the name `mypipe`.
    - Select the `dev` stage from the Stages tab.
    - In the `Image stream version` select version `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.1` and push the `Deploy` button.

    ![CD Pipeline Deploy initial version](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/deploy-app-1.png "CD Pipeline deploy")

### Check the Application Status

To ensure the application is deployed successfully, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure application status is `Healthy` and `Synced`, and the `Deployed version` points to `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.1`:

    ![CD Pipeline health status](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/deploy-app-2.png "Pipeline health status")

2. Check that the selected version of the container is deployed on the `dev` environment. `${EDP_ENV}` - is the EDP namespace name:

    ```bash
    # Check the deployment status of fastapi-demo application
    $ kubectl get deployments -n ${EDP_ENV}-mypipe-dev
    NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    fastapi-demo-dl1ft   1/1     1            1           30m

    # Check the image version of fastapi-demo application
    $ kubectl get pods -o jsonpath="{.items[*].spec.containers[*].image}" -n ${EDP_ENV}-mypipe-dev
    012345678901.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/${EDP_ENV}/fastapi-demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.1
    ```

### Deliver New Code

This section describes the `Code Review` process for a new code. We need to deploy a new version of our `fastapi-demo` application that deploys `Ingress` object to expose API outside the Kubernetes cluster.

Perform the below steps to merge new code (Pull Request) that passes the Code Review flow. For the steps below, we use Gerrit UI but the same actions can be performed using the command line and git tool:

1. Login to Gerrit UI, select `fastapi-demo` project, and create a change request.

2. Browse Gerrit Repositories and select `fastapi-demo` project.

    ![Browse Gerrit repositories](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/gerrit-1.png)

3. In the `Commands` section of the project, push the `Create Change` button.

    ![Create Change request](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/gerrit-2.png)

4. In the `Create Change` dialog, provide the branch `main` and the `Description` (commit message):

    ```txt
    Enable ingress for application

    Closes: #xyz
    ```

5. Push the `Create` button.

    ![Create Change](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/gerrit-3.png)

6. Push the `Edit` button of the merge request and add `deployment-templates/values.yaml` for modification.

    ![Update values.yaml file](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/gerrit-4.png)

7. Review the `deployment-templates/values.yaml` file and change the `ingress.enabled` flag from `false` to `true`. Then push the `SAVE & PUBLISH` button. As soon as you get `Verified +1` from CI, you are ready for review: Push the `Mark as Active` button.

    ![Review Change](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/gerrit-5.png)

8. You can always check your pipelines status from:

    - Gerrit UI.

    ![Pipeline Status Gerrit](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/gerrit-6.png)

    - UI Portal.

    ![Pipeline Status Portal](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/gerrit-7.png)

9. With no Code Review Pipeline issues, set `Code-Review +2` for the patchset and push the `Submit` button. Then, your code is merged to the `main` branch, triggering the Build Pipeline. The build Pipeline produces the new version of artifact: `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.2`, which is available for the deployment.

    ![Gerrit Code Review screen](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/gerrit-8.png)

10. Deliver the New Version to the Environment. Before the new version deployment, check the ingress object in `dev` namespace:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get ingress -n ${EDP_ENV}-mypipe-dev
    No resources found in ${EDP_ENV}-mypipe-dev namespace.
    ```

    No ingress object exists as expected.

11. Deploy the new version `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.2` which has the ingress object in place. Since we use `Manual` deployment approach, we perform version upgrade by hand.

    - Go to the `CD Pipelines` section of the `EDP Portal`, select `mypipe` pipeline and choose `dev` stage.
    - In the `Image stream version` select the new version `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.2` and push the `Update` button.
    - Check that the new version is deployed: application status is `Healthy` and `Synced`, and the `Deployed version` points to `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.2`.

    ![CD Pipeline Deploy New Version](../assets/use-cases/fastapi-scaffolding/cdpipeline-newversion.png)

12. Check that the new version with Ingress is deployed:

    ```bash
    # Check the version of the deployed image
    kubectl get pods -o jsonpath="{.items[*].spec.containers[*].image}" -n ${EDP_ENV}-mypipe-dev
    012345678901.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/edp-delivery-tekton-dev/fastapi-demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.2

    # Check Ingress object
    kubectl get ingress -n ${EDP_ENV}-mypipe-dev
    NAME                 CLASS    HOSTS                            ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
    fastapi-demo-ko1zs   <none>   fastapi-demo-ko1zs-example.com   12.123.123.123   80      115s

    # Check application external URL
    curl https://your-hostname-appeared-in-hosts-column-above.example.com/
    {"Hello":"World"}
    ```
