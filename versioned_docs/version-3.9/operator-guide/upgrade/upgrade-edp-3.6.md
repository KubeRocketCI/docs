# Upgrade EDP v3.5 to 3.6

:::warning
  We suggest backing up the EDP environment before starting the upgrade procedure.
:::

This section provides detailed instructions for upgrading the EPAM Delivery Platform to version 3.6.0. Follow the steps and requirements outlined below:

1. Update Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Run the following command to apply all the necessary CRDs to the cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epam/edp-codebase-operator/v2.20.0/deploy-templates/crds/v2.edp.epam.com_codebases.yaml
    ```

2. Familiarize yourself with the updated structure of the [values.yaml](https://github.com/epam/edp-install/blob/v3.6.0/deploy-templates/values.yaml#L38) file and adjust it accordingly:

    2.1 A new parameter called [space](https://github.com/epam/edp-install/blob/v3.6.0/deploy-templates/values.yaml#L38) has been added to the `DockerRegistry` section. It is designed to form URLs in CodebaseImageStreams. This parameter is set the same as the `EPAM Delivery Platform` namespace name. Ensure you define the `space` parameter prior to the update.

    :::warning
      This [parameter](https://github.com/epam/edp-install/blob/v3.6.0/deploy-templates/values.yaml#L38) is a significant change and must be set before the update.
    :::

    ```yaml
    global:
      dockerRegistry:
        type: "harbor"
        url: "registry.example.com"
        space: "edp"
    ```

    2.2 Sub components, such as [sonar-operator](https://github.com/epam/edp-sonar-operator), [nexus-operator](https://github.com/epam/edp-nexus-operator), and [keycloak-operator](https://github.com/epam/edp-keycloak-operator), have been removed since dependencies are no longer provisioned by the [edp-install](https://github.com/epam/edp-install/blob/v3.6.0/deploy-templates/values.yaml) Helm Chart. To install and integrate shared components with EDP, please use the [edp-cluster-add-ons](https://github.com/epam/edp-cluster-add-ons) approach or refer to the [SonarQube Integration](../code-quality/sonarqube.md) and [Nexus Sonatype Integration](../artifacts-management/nexus-sonatype.md) documentation pages.

    2.3 The Argo CD integration dependency has been deleted as now we implement it using [edp-cluster-add-ons](https://github.com/epam/edp-cluster-add-ons) approach. To install and integrate Argo CD as a shared component, use the [edp-cluster-add-ons](https://github.com/epam/edp-cluster-add-ons) approach.

    2.4 The handling of secrets for stages namespaces in the [cd-pipeline-operator](https://github.com/epam/edp-cd-pipeline-operator/blob/v2.17.0/deploy-templates/values.yaml#L102) has been updated. The parameter `manageSecrets` has been replaced with `secretManager`. If your environment previously utilized this parameter, manually modify it from `manageSecrets: true` to `secretManager: own`. Otherwise, set it to `secretManager: none`:

    ```yaml
    cd-pipeline-operator:
      # -- flag that indicates whether the operator should manage secrets for stages;
      # own - just copy secrets;
      # eso - secrete will be managed by External Secrets Operator(operator should be installed in the cluster);
      # none - not enable secrets management logic;
      secretManager: none
    ```

3. To upgrade EDP to the v3.6.0, run the following command:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade edp epamedp/edp-install -n edp --values values.yaml --version=3.6.0
    ```

    :::note
      To verify the installation, it is possible to test the deployment before applying it to the cluster with the `--dry-run` tag:<br />
        `helm upgrade edp epamedp/edp-install -n edp --values values.yaml --version=3.6.0 --dry-run`
