# Add Quality Gate

This section describes how to use quality gate in KubeRocketCI and how to customize the quality gate for the CD pipeline with the selected build version of the promoted application between stages.

## Apply New Quality Gate to Pipelines

Quality gate pipeline is a usual Tekton pipeline but with a specific label: `app.edp.epam.com/pipelinetype: deploy`. To add and apply the quality gate to your pipelines, follow the steps below:

1. To use the Tekton pipeline as a quality gate pipeline, add this label to the pipelines:

    ```yaml
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.edp.epam.com/pipelinetype: deploy
    ```

2. Insert the \<name-of-quality-gate\> value that is the quality gate name displayed in the quality gate drop-down list of the CD pipeline menu:

    ```yaml
    metadata:
      name: <name-of-quality-gate>
    ```

3. Ensure the task `promote-images` contains steps and logic to apply to the project. Also ensure that the last task is `promote-images` which parameters are mandatory:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      params:
        - default: ''
          description: Codebases with a tag separated with a space.
          name: CODEBASE_TAG
          type: string
        - default: ''
          name: CDPIPELINE_CR
          type: string
        - default: ''
          name: CDPIPELINE_STAGE
          type: string
      tasks:
        - name: promote-images
          params:
            - name: CODEBASE_TAG
              value: $(params.CODEBASE_TAG)
            - name: CDPIPELINE_STAGE
              value: $(params.CDPIPELINE_STAGE)
            - name: CDPIPELINE_CR
              value: $(params.CDPIPELINE_CR)
          runAfter:
            - <last-task-name>
          taskRef:
            kind: Task
            name: promote-images
    ```

4. Create a new pipeline with a unique name or modify your created pipeline with the command below. Please be aware that the `edp` value is the name of the KubeRocketCI tenant:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml --namespace edp
    ```

  <details>
  <summary><b>Example: Pipeline.yaml</b></summary>
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.edp.epam.com/pipelinetype: deploy
      name: <name-of-quality-gate>
      namespace: edp
    spec:
      params:
        - default: >-
            https://<CI-pipeline-provisioner>-edp.<cluster-name>.aws.main.edp.projects.epam.com/#/namespaces/$(context.pipelineRun.namespace)/pipelineruns/$(context.pipelineRun.name)
          name: pipelineUrl
          type: string
        - default: ''
          description: Codebases with a tag separated with a space.
          name: CODEBASE_TAG
          type: string
        - default: ''
          name: CDPIPELINE_CR
          type: string
        - default: ''
          name: CDPIPELINE_STAGE
          type: string
      tasks:
        - name: autotests
          params:
            - name: BASE_IMAGE
              value: bitnami/kubectl:1.25.4
            - name: EXTRA_COMMANDS
              value: echo "Hello World"
          taskRef:
            kind: Task
            name: run-quality-gate
        - name: promote-images
          params:
            - name: CODEBASE_TAG
              value: $(params.CODEBASE_TAG)
            - name: CDPIPELINE_STAGE
              value: $(params.CDPIPELINE_STAGE)
            - name: CDPIPELINE_CR
              value: $(params.CDPIPELINE_CR)
          runAfter:
            - autotests
          taskRef:
            kind: Task
            name: promote-images
    ```
  </details>

## Run Quality Gate

Before running the quality gate, first of all, ensure that the environment has deployed the [created CD pipeline](add-cd-pipeline.md) and then ensure that the application is successfully deployed and ready to run the quality gate. To run quality gate, please follow the steps below:

1. Check the CD pipeline status. To do this, open the created CD pipeline, select `Image stream version`, click `DEPLOY` button and wait until `Applications`, `Health` and `Sync` statuses become `green`. This implies that the application is successfully deployed and ready to run the quality gate.

2. Select the name-of-quality-gate of `Quality gates` from the drop-down list and click the `RUN` button.<br />The execution process should be started in the `Pipelines` menu:

## Add Stage for Quality Gate

For a better understanding of this section, please read the documentation about how to [add a new stage for quality gate](add-cd-pipeline.md). The scheme below illustrates two approaches of adding quality gates:

  ![Quality gate promote a scheme](../assets/user-guide/qg_promote_shema.png "Types of adding quality gate")

* The first type of adding a quality gate is about adding the specific quality gate to the specific pipeline stage.

* The second type is rather optional and implies activating the `Promote in pipelines` option while creating a CD Pipeline to pass the quality gate in a certain sequence.

As a result, after the quality gate is successfully passed, the projected image is promoted to the next stage.
